Lock Pattern Grid View Library
==============================

A simple library which provides a pattern lock view, like that of Android pattern lock screen.

To use it, import it as a module in Android Studio (or a library in Eclipse). It is pretty simple; the usage can be easily understood by going through the demo code given inside demo folder

I will update the readme with more details soon
